Packaging of dada2 for EEMiS, and other, users.

[DADA2](http://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) is an error correction algorithm for
Illumina amplicon reads.  This repository offers four R scripts that lets you
run the four main steps (cleaning and merging is performed by the same script)
in the processing separately, saving intermediate results: 

1. `dada2filter`: quality and length trimming
2. `dada2errmodels`: calculation of error models from the data
3. `dada2cleanNmerge`: sequence correction and merge
4. `dada2bimeras`: filter bimeras, create final tables

## Requirements

DADA2 can be installed from the 
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dada2.html)
site.

DADA2 requires headers for the `libcurl4-gnutls` library. In Debian
they can be installed with this command:

```bash
$ sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
```

The Bioconductor package [DECIPHER](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DECIPHER.html) is also required.

## Installation

The scripts in this repository are easiest to install by cloning the repo and 
creating symlinks to the actual scripts in `src/R`.

Assuming you have `$HOME/bin` in your `PATH` variable and a `dev` directory in
your home directory where you keep repositories like this, you would:

```
$ cd ~/dev/
$ git clone https://github.com/erikrikarddaniel/eemisdada2.git
$ cd ~/bin
$ ln -s ~/dev/eemisdada2/src/R/*
$ cd ~
$ dada2filter --version
```

(The last command just checks that everything is working.)

Now, you're ready to run the scripts, in the order specified above, from any
directory. All scripts have a `--help` flag as documentation.

## Automation via Make

In my [`biomakefiles` repository](https://github.com/erikrikarddaniel/biomakefiles),
there's a makefile-based workflow implementation with documentation.
